          <li>Prague is full of tourist traps, usually in the form of irrelevant food or a bad coffee, best to follow the local hipsters and white-collar workers when in the centre</li>
          <li>The riverways that have been inspiring artists for centuries are accessible, and you can rent a paddleboat to explore them in the city centre</li>
          <li>Attending an opera or ballet performance in the State Opera, National or Estate Theatre is comparably cheap to the world and seeing the beautiful interiors itself worth the investment</li>
